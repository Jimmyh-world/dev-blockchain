## Integration with Dev Lab

**Related Documentation**:
- **Theory**: `docs/cardano/midnight-deep-research.md` (comprehensive overview)
- **Infrastructure**: `docs/infrastructure/BLOCKCHAIN-INFRASTRUCTURE-2025.md` (Midnight section)
- **Comparison**: Compare to Cardano/Aiken (transparent vs confidential)

**RAG System**:
- Theoretical foundation (midnight-deep-research.md) already available
- Practical guides (this directory) will be added as created
- Cross-reference with Cardano patterns (on-chain logic design)

**Cross-Chain Research**:
- Midnight enables privacy for Cardano DApps
- Potential hybrid architecture (Cardano public + Midnight private)
- Bridge between chains for private asset movement

## Key Differentiators from Cardano

| Aspect | Cardano (Aiken) | Midnight (Compact) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Privacy** | Fully transparent | Programmable privacy with selective disclosure |
| **Language** | Aiken (Gleam/Rust-like) | Compact (TypeScript DSL) |
| **Execution** | On-chain validation only | On-chain + off-chain (ZK proofs) |
| **State** | Single public UTXO state | Dual state (public ledger + private witness) |
| **Proof System** | Plutus scripts | ZK-SNARKs (Halo2) |
| **Compliance** | Transparent (hard for enterprise) | Selective disclosure (enterprise-ready) |
| **Setup Complexity** | Moderate (node + compiler) | High (node + compiler + proof server + indexer) |

**When to use Midnight vs Cardano**: See `BLOCKCHAIN-INFRASTRUCTURE-2025.md` decision matrix

## Current Status (2025-10-17)

**Network**:
- Testnet-02: ‚úÖ Live and operational (Oct 2024+)
- Mainnet: ‚è≥ Expected Q4 2025

**Knowledge Base**:
- Theory: ‚úÖ Complete (`midnight-deep-research.md`)
- Practice: üî¥ To be created (this directory)

**Beast Infrastructure**:
- Midnight devnet node: üî¥ Not installed (Priority: Month 4)
- Proof server: üî¥ Not installed
- Development tools: üî¥ Not installed

**Next Action**: Extract quick-start guide from `midnight-deep-research.md` when Month 4 begins

---

**Note**: Do not start Midnight work until Phases 1 (Cardano) and 2 (Ergo) are complete. Midnight builds on UTXO understanding and adds significant complexity with ZK proofs. Foundation first, advanced features later!

**Philosophy**: The deep research exists. Now we build muscle memory through practice.

---

**Document Status**: Directory structure ready, awaiting practical implementation (Month 4-6)
