# Ergo Knowledge Base

**Status**: ðŸ”´ TO BE CREATED
**Priority**: HIGH (Month 3 - after Cardano mastery)
**Created**: 2025-10-17

---

## Purpose

This directory will contain comprehensive knowledge base documentation for Ergo blockchain development, focusing on:

- ErgoScript smart contract language
- Ergo UTXO model (comparison to Bitcoin/Cardano)
- Rosen Bridge architecture and operations
- Sigma protocols (zero-knowledge primitives)
- Ergo node operations and maintenance

---

## Planned Documentation

### Core Language & Development

- **`ergosc ript-guide.md`** - ErgoScript syntax, patterns, examples
- **`ergo-utxo-model.md`** - UTXO model, registers, boxes, guards
- **`ergo-security-patterns.md`** - Common vulnerabilities and mitigations
- **`ergo-development-workflow.md`** - Build, test, deploy process

### Rosen Bridge

- **`rosen-bridge-architecture.md`** - Technical architecture, Watcher/Guard model
- **`rosen-bridge-operations.md`** - Running watchers, monitoring events
- **`rosen-bridge-security.md`** - Security model, attack vectors, auditing

### Node Operations

- **`ergo-node-setup.md`** - Installation, configuration, sync
- **`ergo-node-maintenance.md`** - Updates, monitoring, troubleshooting
- **`ergo-api-reference.md`** - REST API endpoints, usage examples

### Cross-Chain Integration

- **`bitcoin-ergo-bridge.md`** - Bitcoin â†’ Ergo bridge mechanisms
- **`cardano-ergo-bridge.md`** - Cardano â†” Ergo via Rosen
- **`cross-chain-security.md`** - Bridge security, validation, proofs

## Research Phase (Month 3)

**Timeline**: After Cardano mastery (2 months), before Midnight (Month 4)

**Objectives**:
1. Understand ErgoScript syntax and how it compares to Aiken
2. Map UTXO model differences (Bitcoin â†’ Cardano â†’ Ergo)
3. Comprehend Rosen Bridge security and operation
4. Deploy Ergo node and sync mainnet
5. Potentially run Rosen Bridge watcher for passive income

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] ErgoScript guide created with 5+ contract examples
- [ ] Can read and understand production ErgoScript contracts
- [ ] Rosen Bridge architecture documented with diagrams
- [ ] Understand cross-chain transaction flow (Bitcoin â†’ Cardano)
- [ ] Ergo node operational and synced

## Integration with Dev Lab

**Related Docs**:
- Infrastructure: `docs/infrastructure/BLOCKCHAIN-INFRASTRUCTURE-2025.md`
- Cardano comparison: `docs/cardano/ethereum-cardano-comparison.md` (expand to include Ergo)
- Cross-chain: Research Bitcoin-Cardano-Ergo connectivity

**RAG System**:
- This knowledge base will be ingested into RAG for AI assistant access
- Focus on practical patterns and security considerations
- Cross-reference with Cardano UTXO patterns
