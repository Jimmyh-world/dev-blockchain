# Midnight Privacy Sidechain Developer Guide

Midnight is Cardano's privacy-focused partner chain that delivers programmable data protection through zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining regulatory compliance—enabling developers to build confidential smart contracts for healthcare, finance, identity, and enterprise applications that require selective disclosure rather than blanket transparency.

## Introduction to Midnight

Midnight represents a fourth-generation blockchain approach developed by Input Output Global (IOG) and now governed by the independent Midnight Foundation and Shielded Technologies. It operates as Cardano's first partner chain, introducing "rational privacy"—programmable data protection with selective disclosure capabilities—rather than the absolute anonymity approach of traditional privacy coins like Monero or Zcash.

**Core positioning**: Midnight is a data protection blockchain, not simply a privacy chain. The distinction matters: developers can programmatically choose what information remains private, what becomes public, and who can access specific data under what conditions. This architecture addresses the fundamental challenge preventing blockchain adoption in regulated industries—the inability to protect sensitive data while maintaining auditability and compliance.

### Relationship to Cardano mainchain

Midnight operates as an independent Layer 1 blockchain with its own consensus mechanism, but maintains strategic partnership with Cardano through multiple integration points. The NIGHT governance token launches initially as a Cardano native asset, with 50% of the 24 billion token supply distributed to ADA holders via the Glacier Drop. Cardano Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) can validate transactions on both chains simultaneously, earning both ADA and NIGHT rewards without compromising their existing operations.

The architecture leverages Cardano's mature SPO infrastructure for security bootstrapping while maintaining operational independence. Settlement and security anchoring occurs through Cardano's proof-of-stake consensus, but Midnight maintains its own complete ledger with dedicated consensus through the Minotaur protocol.

**Current status as of October 2025**: Midnight is in active testnet phase (testnet-02) with mainnet launch expected in Q4 2025 following completion of the Glacier Drop token distribution (Phase 1 ended October 20, 2025). The network features over 7,800 Discord community members, operational testnet with growing developer activity (+42% smart contract calls June-July 2025), and strategic partnerships with Google Cloud, OpenZeppelin, and major infrastructure providers.

## Core Architecture and Technical Foundation

### Zero-knowledge proof implementation

Midnight implements **zk-SNARKs** (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) using the **Halo2** cryptographic framework developed by the Zcash team. The key innovation: Halo2 eliminates trusted setup requirements through recursive proof composition, addressing one of the most significant security concerns in earlier ZK systems.

**Cryptographic specifications**:
- **Proving system**: Halo2 with PLONK polynomial IOP (more efficient than original Sonic protocol)
- **Elliptic curves**: Originally Pluto/Eris half-pairing cycle (446-bit curves for 128-bit security), transitioning to BLS curves for improved performance
- **Polynomial commitment**: Based on inner product arguments
- **Proof characteristics**: Constant size regardless of statement complexity, fast verification, non-interactive

The **Zswap protocol** extends Zerocash with native multi-asset support and atomic swaps. It uses sparse homomorphic commitments with aggregated open randomness and Zcash-friendly simulation-extractable NIZK proofs. Transactions include inputs (spending existing coins via Merkle tree commitments with unlinkable nullifiers), outputs (creating new coin commitments), and transient coins (created and spent within the same transaction for contract fund management).

**Practical ZK proof process**:
1. User initiates transaction with private inputs on local machine
2. Local proof server creates ZK proof confirming validity without revealing private data
3. Proof + public data submitted to blockchain
4. Smart contract verifies proof and updates state if valid
5. User receives confirmation without exposing sensitive information

### Consensus mechanism: Minotaur

Midnight uses **Minotaur**, a multi-resource blockchain consensus protocol that combines Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) to achieve optimal fungibility between different resources. Published at ACM CCS '22 conference and implemented in ~6,000 lines of Rust, Minotaur prevents single-resource attacks (like the 51% hash power vulnerability that affected Monero).

**Key properties**:
- **Epoch-based operation**: Operates in discrete epochs with continuous sampling of active computational power
- **Optimal fungibility**: Security holds as long as cumulative adversarial power across ALL resources remains bounded (<50% total)
- **Resource independence**: No single resource (PoW or PoS alone) can compromise the network
- **Fluctuation tolerance**: Handles higher degrees of work fluctuation compared to Bitcoin

**Validator model**: Cardano SPOs can become Midnight block producers, earning NIGHT tokens from reserve supply in addition to ADA staking rewards. Selection is proportional to delegated ADA stake. Target block utilization is 50% to balance security, decentralization, and economic scarcity. Fixed subsidies provide 95% of base rewards at launch, with planned reduction to 50% via governance to incentivize transaction inclusion.

### Dual-state smart contract architecture

Midnight's programming model separates contract state into two distinct components based on the Kachina protocol (proven in the Universal Composability security framework):

**Public state (ledger)**: Stored on-chain, replicated across the Midnight blockchain, visible to all participants. Contains transaction proofs, nullifiers, coin commitments, and publicly verifiable data.

**Private state (witnesses)**: Maintained locally on users' machines, never exposed on-chain. Includes sensitive user data, private inputs to computations, and confidential contract parameters.

**Execution flow**: Smart contracts operate as holistic state machines spanning both user's local systems and the replicated on-chain state. Private computation occurs client-side with local proof generation, while only zero-knowledge proofs are submitted and verified on-chain. This architecture enables concurrency—multiple actors can perform tasks simultaneously through transaction reordering and conflict optimization via transcripts that record operations without leaking information.

### Data availability and settlement

Midnight maintains its own complete ledger with full data availability on the Midnight blockchain. Private data never appears on any chain—it remains exclusively on users' local machines. Cardano serves multiple strategic roles: security provider through SPO participation, token launch platform for NIGHT distribution, and interoperability layer for cross-chain asset movement.

The network prioritizes service availability over raw speed, mirroring Cardano's commitment to 5+ years of uninterrupted uptime. Users always have access to their data when needed, with selective disclosure enabling programmable auditability for regulators without compromising privacy for other parties.

## Development Framework and Programming Model

### Compact: TypeScript-based smart contract language

**Compact** is Midnight's domain-specific language for writing privacy-preserving smart contracts. Built on TypeScript foundations, Compact provides familiar syntax while restricting certain features for security and proof generation requirements.

**Key characteristics**:
- **TypeScript-based DSL**: Integrates seamlessly with JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem
- **Privacy-first design**: Native support for handling both public and private data with ZK proofs
- **Statically typed**: Enforces strict control over input types, transitions, and state changes
- **Circuit-based model**: Smart contracts defined as circuits running both on-chain and off-chain

**Basic contract structure**:

```compact
include "std";

ledger {
    // Public state visible on Midnight blockchain
    count: Unsigned64;
}

// Transition function changing public state
export circuit increment(): Void {
    ledger.count = ledger.count + 1;
}
```

**Key components explained**:
- `ledger`: Declares public state stored on blockchain
- `circuit`: Defines operations (functions) that can be executed
- `export`: Makes circuits publicly callable
- `include "std"`: Imports the standard library

**Compilation process**: The Compact compiler (`compactc`) generates multiple outputs:
1. **Contract files**: TypeScript/JavaScript API definitions for client integration
2. **ZKIR files**: Zero-Knowledge Intermediate Representations for circuits
3. **Keys**: Prover and verifier keys for each circuit
4. **TypeScript definitions**: Generated interfaces including Circuits, Ledger fields, and Witnesses

### Differences from Aiken/Plutus development

| Aspect | Midnight (Compact) | Plutus (Haskell) | Aiken (Rust-inspired) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Language basis** | TypeScript DSL | Haskell subset | Gleam/Rust/Elm hybrid |
| **Compilation target** | ZK circuits + UPLC-equivalent | Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC) | Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC) |
| **Privacy model** | Built-in ZK proofs, dual state | Fully transparent on-chain | Fully transparent on-chain |
| **State management** | Public ledger + private witness | Single public UTXO state | Single public UTXO state |
| **Execution model** | Hybrid on-chain/off-chain with local proofs | Pure on-chain validation | Pure on-chain validation |
| **Developer experience** | TypeScript familiarity, ZK abstraction | Steep learning curve (functional) | Moderate curve (modern syntax) |
| **Setup complexity** | Requires proof server + infrastructure | Standard node + compiler | Standard node + compiler |

**Key differentiators**:
- **Privacy architecture**: Private inputs stay local in Midnight; all transaction data visible on-chain in Cardano
- **Programming paradigm**: Imperative TypeScript-style circuits vs. functional programming (Plutus) vs. modern functional (Aiken)
- **Smart contract model**: Kachina protocol circuit-based (Midnight) vs. UTXO validator scripts (Cardano)
- **Complexity trade-offs**: Easier language but more complex infrastructure for Midnight; harder languages but simpler infrastructure for Cardano

### Testing and deployment

3. **Full cloud**: All services hosted remotely with encrypted access
4. **Office/lab server**: Centralized server accessed from multiple devices

## Privacy Features and Compliance Capabilities

### Programmable selective disclosure

Unlike binary public/private systems, Midnight enables a **spectrum of privacy**. Developers programmatically define what data is public versus private in smart contracts, with users controlling which data is disclosed and to whom through zero-knowledge proofs that verify claims without exposing sensitive information.

**Mechanism**: Access keys allow specific actors (such as regulators) to view certain encrypted data while keeping it hidden from others. Smart contracts define access control rules at development time, users generate ZK proofs about private data, proofs are posted on-chain (not the data itself), and authorized parties use access keys to view specific encrypted data.

**Practical examples**:
1. **Age verification**: Prove you're over 18 without revealing exact birthdate, address, or other personal details
2. **KYC compliance**: Verify credentials without revealing unnecessary personal information
3. **Medical records**: Prove existence of medical condition without sharing full medical history
4. **Credit scoring**: Assign scores to decentralized identifiers without leaking to malicious actors
5. **Financial compliance**: Prove not on sanctions list without revealing all business details

**What data is private vs. public**:

**Private (shielded)**:
- Transaction amounts when using DUST
- Wallet addresses when shielded
- Smart contract private state/witnesses
- User identity information
- Transaction metadata
- Business-sensitive data in contracts

**Public (unshielded)**:
- Smart contract public state (ledger)
- NIGHT token transactions (governance)
- ZK proofs themselves (not underlying data)
- Block production information
- Network consensus data

### Dual-token privacy model

**NIGHT Token (unshielded)**:
- Network governance and consensus token
- Deflationary with fixed total supply of 24 billion
- All tokens minted on Cardano, exists natively on both Cardano and Midnight
- Publicly visible for regulatory compliance and transparency
- Enables consensus participation and block rewards
- Generates DUST continuously when held

**DUST Token (shielded)**:
- Shielded, non-transferable operational resource for transaction fees
- Generated continuously by holding NIGHT (proportional to NIGHT holdings)
- Decays when disconnected from generating NIGHT address
- Burns when used for transactions
- Protects metadata during transactions to prevent data correlation
- Subunit: 1 DUST = 1,000,000 SPECK

**Key innovation**: Separating the tradable governance asset (NIGHT) from the operational resource (DUST) delivers privacy for on-chain activity while addressing regulatory requirements. Users holding NIGHT can transact "effectively free" as long as they generate sufficient DUST, providing predictable cost models for businesses unlike traditional gas fee volatility.

### Regulatory compliance design

**Compliance capabilities**:

**1. Selective auditability**: Regulators can be granted access keys to view specific encrypted data, audit capabilities can be built into smart contracts at design time, verification without full disclosure enables "proof of compliance" rather than blanket data transmission.

**2. Regulatory alignment**:
- **GDPR compliance**: Data minimization principle adherence, users control data disclosure, private data not stored on public ledger, selective sharing with authorized parties only
- **Financial regulations**: AML (prove not on sanctions list without revealing all data), KYC (verify credentials while protecting sensitive information), PCI standards support
- **Healthcare regulations**: HIPAA compliance for protected health information (PHI), selective sharing of medical records to authorized parties, patient confidentiality maintained

**3. Contrast with privacy chains**: Unlike Monero/Zcash which implement "blanket secrecy" raising regulatory concerns and exchange delisting, Midnight enables verification when legally required, balances confidentiality with regulatory compliance, and provides "controlled transparency" that avoids issues facing pure privacy coins.

**Use cases requiring compliance**:
- **Finance**: Institutional KYC/AML verification while protecting client data
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant medical record systems with selective provider access
- **Identity**: Self-sovereign identity with selective credential disclosure
- **Voting**: Fraud-resistant balloting proving eligibility without revealing individual votes
- **Asset tokenization**: On-chain ownership records without compromising owner identity
- **TradFi integration**: Bridge between traditional finance and DeFi with compliance built-in

### Privacy-functionality trade-offs

**Technical trade-offs**:

**1. Complexity vs. accessibility**: ZK proofs involve intricate mathematical operations (elliptic curve pairings, advanced algebraic techniques), but Compact language abstracts cryptographic complexity so developers can build privacy apps without specialized cryptography knowledge.

**2. Performance considerations**:
- **Proof generation**: Requires computational resources but occurs off-chain (client-side) avoiding blockchain bottleneck
- **Verification efficiency**: Constant proof size means verification remains efficient regardless of statement complexity
- **Concurrency optimization**: Transcripts enable transaction reordering, minimizing information leakage while maximizing throughput

**3. State management**: Requires maintaining both public and private state, users must manage local state for private data, more complex than pure public or pure private systems.

**Functional limitations**:
- **Programming constraints**: Compact is more restricted than full TypeScript, certain features intentionally omitted for proof generation, statically typed to enable necessary proofs and analyses
- **Developer experience**: New programming paradigm (circuits, witnesses, ledger), requires understanding ZK concepts at high level, different mental model than traditional smart contracts (mitigated by TypeScript familiarity)
- **Infrastructure requirements**: Local proof generator software needed for clients, pub-sub indexer for querying ledger data, wallet integration (Lace wallet), enterprise infrastructure support via Google Cloud partnership

**Acknowledged privacy limitations**:
- **Not complete anonymity**: Not designed for "blanket secrecy" like pure privacy coins; selective disclosure means some data can be revealed when authorized
- **Trust assumptions**: Users must trust access key holders won't misuse data; smart contract logic determines who can access what; requires proper key management
- **Metadata protection**: While DUST shields transaction metadata, network-level information may still be observable; light clients reduce but don't eliminate metadata exposure; timing and traffic analysis remain considerations

## Use Cases and Decision Matrix

### When to build on Midnight vs Cardano mainchain

**Build on Midnight when**:
- **Privacy is paramount**: Applications requiring sensitive data protection (healthcare records, financial transactions, supply chain with confidential terms)
- **Metadata protection needed**: Transaction details, wallet addresses, and values must remain private
- **Selective disclosure required**: Need to prove facts without revealing underlying data (age verification without revealing birthdate)
- **Regulatory compliance critical**: Applications must meet GDPR, HIPAA, or similar data protection requirements
- **Zero-knowledge proofs essential**: Use cases that benefit from privacy-preserving computation

**Build on Cardano mainchain when**:
- **Full transparency needed**: Public voting, public fundraising, transparent token distributions
- **Established ecosystem required**: Need access to mature DeFi protocols, DEXs, and existing liquidity
- **Lower complexity acceptable**: Standard smart contract use cases without privacy requirements
- **Public audit trails beneficial**: Applications where transparency builds trust
- **Native DID solutions**: Decentralized identity using Atala PRISM

**Build on both (hybrid approach) when**:
- **Mixed privacy needs**: Some data public (token supply, basic transaction counts), some private (user balances, transaction details)
- **Cross-chain asset movement**: Need to transfer ADA, tokens, NFTs, or stablecoins between chains for private operations
- **Leverage both ecosystems**: Use Cardano SPOs for block production security while providing privacy features
- **DID with privacy**: Use Cardano for public DIDs while protecting sensitive attributes via Midnight

### Ideal use cases by industry

**Healthcare**:
- **Medical record management**: Systems like MediChain (hackathon winner) using ZK-SNARKs ensuring HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- **Patient data exchange**: Secure sharing of health records between providers without exposing sensitive information
- **Clinical trials**: Privacy-preserving data sharing for research while protecting patient identity
- **Pharmaceutical supply chain**: Track drug authenticity from manufacturer to consumer with confidential pricing, preventing $43 billion in annual counterfeit drug losses

- **Privacy-preserving NFTs**: NMKR implementing native NFT minting with privacy architecture
- **Confidential in-game assets**: Ownership and attributes without public exposure
- **Prediction markets**: Bodega Market bringing private prediction markets to Midnight

### Performance characteristics and cost model

**Performance specifications**:
- **Consensus**: Multi-resource (Minotaur) combining PoW + PoS hybrid
- **Block finalization**: GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) providing deterministic finality
- **Block production**: AURA (Authority Round) round-robin validator system
- **Expected block time**: 1-10 seconds range at mainnet launch (exact value TBD)
- **Target block utilization**: 50% (allows headroom for demand spikes without congestion)
- **Scalability features**: Off-chain computation (private state computed locally, only proofs posted on-chain), efficient Halo2 cryptography optimized for verification speed

**Current limitations**: Specific TPS metrics not publicly disclosed (testnet phase). Performance data will become available after mainnet launch and production usage under real-world load conditions.

**Cost structure using dual-token system**:

Transaction fees paid in DUST follow the formula:
```
Transaction Fee = (Congestion Rate × Transaction Weight) + Minimum Fee
```

**Components**:
- **Minimum Fee**: Fixed parameter preventing DDoS attacks
- **Congestion Rate**: Dynamic multiplier based on network demand (adjusted per block)
- **Transaction Weight**: Initially based on size (KB), will expand to include compute and I/O

**Dynamic pricing mechanism**: Fees rise when blocks exceed 50% full, decrease when below. Self-regulating system maintains optimal capacity. Rising costs + ZK proof recomputation costs deter attackers.

**Predictable cost model advantage**: "Effectively free" transactions for NIGHT holders. Holding NIGHT generates unlimited DUST over time with no recurring capital expenditure (unlike traditional gas fees). Businesses can predict capacity planning costs. Similar to "unlimited transit pass" with rate limit based on NIGHT holdings.

**Comparison to Cardano mainchain**:
- **Cardano**: ADA spent per transaction (0.16-0.17 ADA typical, ~$0.09), formula-based with min fee + size component, subject to ADA price volatility, all transactions publicly visible
- **Midnight**: DUST consumed per transaction (renewable resource), dynamic based on congestion, decoupled from token price (stable DUST generation rate), shielded fees/transactions not publicly visible
- **Long-term Midnight advantage**: No ongoing token expenditure for heavy users
- **Short-term Cardano advantage**: Lower barrier to entry, established infrastructure

## Integration Patterns and Cross-Chain Communication

### Bridge architecture between Midnight and Cardano

**Current status**: Bridge infrastructure under active development through multiple Project Catalyst proposals. Midnight operates as independent blockchain with separate consensus, requiring dedicated bridge mechanisms.

**Primary implementation: Wanchain ZK Proof Relayer Bridge** (Project Catalyst Fund 13):

**Technical approach**:
1. User initiates transaction on source chain (Cardano or Midnight)
2. ZKP prover detects user's transaction on source chain
3. ZKP prover computes proof attesting to transaction authenticity
4. Proof transmitted to smart contract on target chain for verification
5. Target chain verifies proof and releases/mints corresponding assets

**Architecture components**:
- Smart contracts for lock/unlock operations on Cardano (Pre-Production and Mainnet)
- Smart contracts for lock/unlock/burn/mint on Midnight (Testnet and Mainnet)
- Off-chain proof server for ZK proof generation
- On-chain proof verification mechanisms

**Fallback mechanism**: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Relayer will be deployed if ZKP relayer proves unachievable, ensuring decentralized bridge delivery regardless. Multiple parties participate in transaction verification for security.

**Budget**: ~$300,000 USD for development (Wanchain team with blockchain interoperability experience since 2017)

### Asset bridging capabilities

**Supported assets**:

**1. ADA (Cardano native token)**:
- Seamless transfer between Cardano mainnet and Midnight
- Lock/unlock mechanism on Cardano side
- Wrapped representation on Midnight for private operations

**2. NIGHT (Midnight utility token)**:
- Initially minted on Cardano as native asset (24 billion total supply)
- Transferable between chains via bridge
- Generates DUST (shielded resource for transaction fees)
- Exists natively on both Cardano and Midnight

**3. Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs)**:
- Full support for custom tokens minted on Cardano
- Bridge infrastructure reduces engineering burden after initial implementation
- Enables DeFi applications across both chains

**4. Planned support**:
- USDC stablecoin for DeFi applications
- Other major crypto assets (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, AVAX, BNB) via multi-chain bridges
- Cross-chain DeFi bridges to multiple ecosystems for interoperability

**zkAssets mechanism**: Users deposit Cardano tokens into bridge smart contract, which mints privacy-preserving zkAssets (zkCNTs) representing original tokens 1:1. Verifiable smart contracts on both chains govern minting/burning. Selective disclosure allows optional revealing of transaction information while maintaining privacy. Value guaranteed by underlying Cardano tokens in secure storage (up to 98% in multi-sig cold storage using Fireblocks).

**Bridge operations flow**:

**Deposit (Cardano → Midnight)**:
1. User locks assets in Cardano smart contract
2. Bridge detects lock transaction
3. Equivalent zkAssets minted on Midnight
4. User receives privacy-shielded representation

**Withdrawal (Midnight → Cardano)**:
1. User burns zkAssets on Midnight
2. ZK proof generated attesting to burn
3. Proof verified on Cardano
4. Assets unlocked from Cardano contract

**Security considerations**: Trustless operation through verifiable smart contracts, multi-sig cold storage for locked assets, Fireblocks and leading technologies for security infrastructure, no centralized control points, decentralized validator network for bridge operations.

### Cross-chain communication patterns

**Fairgate technology**: Cross-chain swap infrastructure ("Hydra meets Lightning") enabling sub-60-second settlement for swaps under $1,000 with transaction fees under $0.01. Outperforms Ethereum Layer 2 and Cardano mainnet through operator bundling model similar to early Bitcoin mining economics. Enables atomic token swaps via Zswap ledger.

**Interoperability design**: Midnight designed to work with Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, XRP Ledger, and Bitcoin—not just Cardano. "Cooperative economics" model emphasizes integration rather than competition. Babel fee model allows users to pay transaction fees in multiple tokens (NIGHT, BTC, ETH, etc.) rather than requiring ecosystem-specific tokens.

**Cross-chain smart contracts**: Confidential contracts can span multiple chains, enabling private computation layers for existing blockchain ecosystems. Midnight can serve as privacy infrastructure layer for DApps on other transparent blockchains without requiring complete migration.

### Off-chain integration: wallets, indexers, and infrastructure

**Wallet support** (as of October 2025):

**Cardano native wallets**:
- **Lace Wallet** (primary integration, v2.0.0+): Developed by IOG, first wallet to integrate Midnight, supports both public and shielded transactions, native connectivity via CIP-30 standard, XRP integration planned before end of 2025
- **Eternl**, **Yoroi** (EMURGO with Ledger hardware wallet integration), **Typhon**, **Gero Wallet**, **NuFi** (multi-chain), **VESPR**, **Begin Wallet**

**Multi-chain wallets**:

- **Trezor**: Native support with CIP-8/CIP-30 message signing capability
- **Keystone**: Works with compatible software wallets (not fully verified for all chains)

**Wallet connectivity standards**:
- **CIP-30**: Cardano standard for DApp wallet connections (native)
- **WalletConnect (Reown)**: Industry-standard protocol for non-Cardano networks
- **Bech32m**: New default address format (human-readable, error detection, metadata support)

**Midnight Indexer** (Rust-based, v2.0.0+ April 2025):

**Architecture**:
- **Language**: Rust (replaced legacy Scala Pub-Sub Indexer)
- **Design**: Modular, service-oriented for improved performance
- **Database support**: PostgreSQL and SQLite
- **API**: GraphQL with queries, mutations, and real-time subscriptions
- **Compatibility**: Wallet SDK v4+, Lace Wallet v2.0.0+

**Capabilities**:
- Retrieves block history from Midnight nodes and processes blockchain data
- Real-time blockchain data streaming via WebSocket (@polkadot/api)
- Historical transaction queries for wallet history
- Smart contract state monitoring for DApp synchronization
- Block explorer functionality for network transparency

**Deployment**: Local development environments and cloud deployment ready with Docker support for containerization.

**Use cases**: DApp data synchronization, wallet balance tracking, transaction history retrieval, smart contract event monitoring, block explorer backends.

**Example project**: **Nocturne Explorer** (privacy-first block explorer for Midnight testnet) - GitHub: https://github.com/longphanquangminh/midnight-explorer, Live: https://midnight-explorer-sand.vercel.app. Features real-time data with no 3rd-party indexer dependency.

**RPC endpoints**: Midnight JSON-RPC API provided by Ankr (https://rpc.ankr.com/midnight_testnet/) supporting standard Polkadot/Substrate RPC methods including `system_chain`, `system_version`, `account_nextIndex`, `chain_getBlockHash`.

**Node infrastructure requirements**:
- **Development environment**: Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL with resources for full non-block-producing node, local proof server, indexer, and client software
- **Node types**: Full nodes (complete blockchain validation), non-block-producing nodes (network participation without mining), operator nodes (bundle transactions for Fairgate layer)
- **Proof server**: Generates zero-knowledge proofs for private transactions, can run locally for maximum privacy or in cloud for convenience

**Architecture flexibility spectrum**:
1. **Full local**: Browser DApp + Proof Server + Indexer + Node (all local for maximum privacy)
2. **Hybrid**: Local Proof Server + Cloud Indexer/Node (recommended for development)
3. **Cloud**: Cloud-hosted infrastructure accessed from mobile (convenience over privacy)
4. **Third-party**: Trusted provider hosts all backend services (easiest setup)

## Security Model and Best Practices

### Security assumptions and trust model

**Foundation**: Midnight's security model combines multi-resource consensus (Minotaur), zero-knowledge cryptography (Halo2), and Cardano partnership for validator infrastructure.

**Trust model principles**:
- **Selective disclosure architecture**: "Rational privacy" model with programmable control over data access rather than blanket transparency or opacity
- **Decentralized data storage**: Private data stored locally on users' devices, not on-chain, eliminating honeypot breach risks
- **Dual ledger system**: Combines shielded (private) and unshielded (public) ledgers for flexible data handling appropriate to each use case
- **Kachina-based contracts**: Architecture enabling contracts to alternate between public and private states with cryptographic proofs of correct execution
- **Block utilization target**: 50% target balances security, decentralization, and network capacity with headroom for demand spikes

**Security properties of Minotaur consensus**:
- **Multi-resource security**: Prevents 51% attacks on single resource type (PoW or PoS alone)
- **Optimal fungibility**: Security maintained when combined adversarial power across all resources <50% total
- **Fluctuation tolerance**: Handles higher degree of work fluctuation compared to Bitcoin
- **Checks and balances**: Multi-resource consensus ensures no single resource type can compromise network

### Audit status and security considerations

**Third-party audits**: Token distribution smart contracts scheduled for comprehensive third-party security audits per Tokenomics Whitepaper (June 2025). Specific audit firms not publicly disclosed as of October 2025. Veridise mentioned in ecosystem as providing "industry-leading blockchain security audits for all verticals of the Web3 ecosystem, including smart contracts, zero-knowledge circuits, blockchain implementations."

**Internal security reviews**: IOG's rigorous academic approach to development with peer-reviewed research publications. Extensive testing through devnet (early 2024) and testnet phases (October 2024-present). Minotaur consensus model based on published research paper (ACM CCS '22).

**Current status (testnet phase)**:
- Pre-production status means network not yet production-ready
- Chain resets minimized during testnet upgrades but still possible
- Not all mainnet features available during testnet
- Hardware requirements must be met for secure operation

**Security considerations highlighted**:
- **ZK complexity**: Zero-knowledge proofs complex to implement correctly, requiring careful development and testing
- **Data exposure risks**: Midnight Academy Module 7 focuses on "unique security considerations for ZK applications, including data exposure minimization"
- **Computational overhead**: ZK proofs require significant computational resources for proof generation and verification

**No critical vulnerabilities reported**: No public reports of major security breaches or vulnerabilities in Midnight as of October 2025. Network benefits from IOG's reputation for security-first development approach. Charles Hoskinson praised Midnight's security model in comparison to other privacy chains post-Monero attack.

### Best practices for secure Midnight development

**Midnight Academy Module 7 - Security and Best Practices** (released August 2025):
- Focuses on unique security considerations for ZK applications
- Covers data exposure minimization techniques
- Teaches secure architecture principles for privacy-preserving apps
- Part of comprehensive developer curriculum (7 of 8 modules released)

**Smart contract development security guidelines**:

**1. Use Compact language properly**:
- Leverage TypeScript-based DSL designed with security built-in
- Follow language restrictions (intentional limitations enhance security)
- Properly segregate public and private state
- Use static typing to enable necessary proofs and analyses

**2. Minimize data exposure**:
- Only expose necessary data on-chain
- Keep sensitive data on user devices, never on blockchain
- Implement selective disclosure thoughtfully—default to private
- Document privacy assumptions and data flows clearly

**3. Proper state management**:
- Separate public state (ledger) from private state (witnesses)
- Ensure correct witness handling to prevent leakage
- Validate all state transitions with appropriate proofs
- Test state management thoroughly on testnet

**4. Proof verification**:
- Ensure proper ZK proof validation in contracts
- Never skip proof verification steps
- Understand proof generation requirements
- Test proof generation/verification flow extensively

**5. Local data security**:
- Secure local proof server setup
- Protect private keys and witnesses
- Implement proper access controls
- Use HD wallet derivation for enhanced security

**Recommended development workflow**:
1. Follow Midnight Developer Academy curriculum (https://midnight.network/developer-hub)
2. Use official example DApps as templates (example-counter, example-bboard)
3. Participate in Midnight Developer Forums for peer review
4. Test extensively on testnet-02 before mainnet deployment
5. Keep contracts simple and modular for easier auditing
6. Document all privacy assumptions and data flow diagrams
7. Conduct security reviews before production deployment

**Tools for secure development**:
- **Compact Developer Tools** (v0.2 August 2025): Standardized development toolchain
- **midnight.js**: Official TypeScript API for DApp development
- **@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime**: Runtime package for contract interaction
- **OpenZeppelin Compact Contracts**: Use audited contract libraries when available (in development)
- **Veridise audits**: Consider professional ZK circuit and contract audits

**Infrastructure security**:
- Run proof servers in trusted environments (local or secure cloud)
- Use encrypted connections for cloud-hosted infrastructure
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Monitor indexer and node health
- Keep all software components updated
